		<p>Agent 47 is the main character throughout all of these games. He is also who you will play as remaining the only playable NPC, 47 was made by Dr Ort meyer in  his asylum,he is a genetically enhanced killer who was made up of 5 different DNA's. The DNA used are from 5 people regarded as the "Founding Fathers" of all of the clones. He was born on the 5th of September 1964 amongst many other clones who either died or never escaped the lab except from very few. He had the numbers "640509-040147" tattooed on the back of his head ("64-05-09" is the date of creation, "04" marks he is part of Series IV, "01" marks that he is the first, and "47" is to represent that he is the 47th), followed several years later by a Universal Product Code. Dr. Ort-Meyer saw 47 as his first genetically complete success and gave him slightly more attention, even though he had other specimens to consider.</p>
